= Spreedly Extension for Radiant

Adds support for paid subscriptions through Spreedly.

== Installation

From the target Radiant project:
  
  git clone git://github.com/pelargir/radiant-spreedly-extension.git vendor/extensions/spreedly

Start your project, login as an admin, and visit the Extensions page. The Spreedly
extension should be listed there.

== Configuring Spreedly

If you haven't registered with Spreedly, go ahead and sign up for an account. Once
you've logged in, choose either the testing or production environment based on whether
you want to test your subscription service or actually start charging people.

Under Configuration, choose or create the subscription plan you want to use. Change
its return URL to:

  http://domain.com/subscriber

Where domain.com is your web site URL. Also under Configuration, go into Site URLs
and set the Subscribers Changed Notification URL to:

  http://domain.com/subscriber_actions/changed

== Configuring the Spreedly Extension

Spreedly must also be configured on your local site. Login as an admin and click the
"Spreedly" tab, then click edit. Enter the your Spreedly account name and the ID of
the subscription plan you want to use. Mode can be set to "Testing" when you're
testing your site with Spreedly, but you should change it to "Production" when you
actually want to start charging users for subscriptions.

== Managing Subscribers

Login as an admin and click on the Subscribers tab to view a list of subscribers
who have registered on your site. You can edit existing subscribers to change their
password or email address from this page. New subscribers can also be created
if you'd prefer to bypass registration through the site.

== Subscription Plans

The extension only supports using one subscription plan at this time.

== Protecting Pages

To make a page accessible to subscribers only, set its page type to "Subscribers Only."
The next time a user visits the page, they will be prompted to login or register.
They won't be able to access the protected page until they have registered and paid
for a subscription through Spreedly.

== Radius Tags

Note: These tags are intended to be used only on pages that are "Subscribers Only."
They won't work as expected when used on other pages.

<r:subscriber:username />
Renders the username of the current subscriber.

<r:subscriber:logout />
Renders a logout link for the current subscriber.
