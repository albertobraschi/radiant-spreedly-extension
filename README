= Spreedly Extension for Radiant

Adds support for paid subscriptions through Spreedly.

== Installation

From the target Radiant project:
  
  git clone git://github.com/pelargir/radiant-spreedly-extension.git vendor/extensions/spreedly

Start your project, login as an admin, and visit the Extensions page. The Spreedly
extension should be listed there.

== Configuring Spreedly

TODO

== Managing Subscribers

TODO

== Subscription Plans

The extension only supports using one subscription plan at this time.

== Protecting Pages

To make a page accessible to subscribers only, set its page type to "Subscribers Only."
The next time a user visits the page, they will be prompted to login or register.
They won't be able to access the protected page until they have registered and paid
for a subscription through Spreedly.

== Radius Tags

<r:subscriber:logout />
Renders a logout link

<r:subscriber:identity />
Renders the identity string of the logged in subscriber.
